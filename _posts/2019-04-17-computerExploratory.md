Exploring how best to serve the students
What to learn first and how technology fits into their lives

The class met up 3 more times since my last post. Started an exploratory computer class to determine what resources are needed to best serve my students and what courses and workshops I would need to provide.

Based on the past 11 weeks, I have observed that either my students didn't have a computer other than a smartphone. A couple did have Ipads but learning how to use them was difficult, so it was very difficult to participate in class. The ones with smartphones, there was much to learn how to properly access their email accounts, to set them up. The mobility to type was difficult on a touch screen for the population that I am serving. The past 11 weeks, I have found when I started the computer class that I needed everyone to be on the same device, even to learn to understand any devices that they did have, they had to be able to learn to search, connect to the internet, set up email account, activate a Roku, firestick account. Compare prices for internet services, test internet speed. etc..

My previous post gives a better understanding of where on challenges our, and small steps of successes along the way.

## resources 
* Chrome Laptops for a computer class to use while in class. - with mouses ..
* Desktop or laptop to those who completed the class and are still passionate to move forward with learning the IoT. with mouses and keyboard. ..
* Password book - or similar to track online accounts., ..
* school supplies, - paper, pencils, ink for the printer, etc. ..
* Hot Spot for good continuation of internet access while teaching class. ..
* Comfortable environment. Some days, a student has pain, not feeling good, and still come to class.

I often think about a non-profit that can serve the technology needs of my community that could be extrapolated to other local communities. I feel the golden years' population has so much to offer and want to find their way in the world, to be independent for as long as they can. Passionate learners. I would love to serve this population of thriving seniors.
