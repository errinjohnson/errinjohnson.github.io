## Exxploring how best to serve the students
### What to learn first and how techonology fits into their lives

The class met up 3 more time since my last post.  Started a exploratory computer class to determine
what resources are needed to best serve my students and what courses and workshops I would need to 
provide. 

Based on the past 11 weeks, I have observed that either my students didnt have a computer other than a 
smart phone.  A couple did have Ipads but learning how to use them was difficult , so it was very difficult
to particpate in class. The ones with smart phones, there was much to learn how to properly access thier email
accounts, to set them up.  The mobility to type was difficult on touch screen for the population that I am serving.
The past 11 weeks, I have found when I started the computer class that I needed everyone to be on the same device, even
to learn to understand any devices that they did have, they had to be able to learn to serach, connect to the internet, set 
up email account, activate a roku, firestick account.  Compare prices for internet services, test internet speed.  etc.. 

My previous post give a better understaind on where on challenges our, and small steps of successes along the way. 

##resources
 ..* Chrome Laptops for computer class to use while in class.   - with mouses
 ..* Desktop or laptop to those who completed the class and are still passonate to move forward with learning the IoT. with mouses and keyboard.
 ..* Password book - or similar to track online accounts.,
 ..* school supplies, - paper , pencils, ink for printer etc.
 ..* Hot Spot for good continuation of internet access while teaching class.
 ..* Comfortable environment. Some days, a student has pain, not feeling good, and still come to class.  
 
 I often think about a non-profit that can serve the technology needs of my community that could be
 extrapolated to other local communities.  I feel the golden years population has so much to offer and want to 
 find their way in the world, to be indepentent for as long as they can.  Passionate learners.  I would love to
 serve this population of thriving seniors.
