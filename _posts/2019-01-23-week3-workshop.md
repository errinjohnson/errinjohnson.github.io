### This day was a continuation on the streaming video workshop; the main focus was on the physical topology.
## SMART TV, FIRE STICK, and OTA(Over The Air - Antenna).

Activities:
1. Participants practiced setting up the fire stick, including registration of the device.
2. Participants practiced setting up OTA.
3. Participants practiced navigating devices to understand the differences between internet tv(smart tv) and streaming video and OTA.
4. The workshop started with an overview of the email and searching the web.

Home Work:

- Karen:  OTA - with her tv
- Kenny:  Informed decisions on a streaming device, interested in purchasing one.
- Linda: Overall exploration of streaming video. 
- Mae: Email and attachments - would like to send pictures to family and friends.
- Mary: Understanding her Smart TV and OTA. 
  - Home visit: 
  I went to Mary's apartment to see her devices.  She had a Smart TV with ethernet, OTA and spectrum internet.
  Mary didn't realize that her OTA was not connected, didn't know how to set up smart tv to the internet.  I tested her internet and the wifi speed was an average of 3.5 MBS. Mary previous had a subscription to Spectrum to receive local channels because her antenna was not broadcasting them, but the cost was not sustainable.  Her wifi signal was not strong enough for streaming video.  I provided her with an ethernet RJ45 cable and connected wired to her smart tv.  This resolved the problem to her streaming video and local channels access. We practiced navigating the smart tv and setting up free trials of Hulu and Netflix.  
  I advised to keep practicing and let me know of any concerns or what is working at our next workshop.
  
  Summary:
  Great participation, streaming video, in the workshop.  The hands-on experiences helped significantly in learning and maintaining concepts.
