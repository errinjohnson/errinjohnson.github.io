## This day was a continuation on the streaming video workshop; the main focus was on the physical topology.
## Smart tv, FIRE STICK, and OTA(Over The Air - Antenna).

Activites:
1. Participants practiced setting up the fire stick, including registration of device.
2. Participants practiced setting up OTA.
3. Particpants practiced navigating the smart tv to understand the differnces of internet tv(smart tv) and OTA.
4. We started workshop with an overview of email and searching the web.

Home Work:

- Karen:  OTA - with her tv
- Kenny:  Informed decisions on a streaming device, interested in purchasing one.
- Linda: Overall exploration of streaming video. 
- Mae: Email and attachements - would like to send pictures to family and friends.
- Mary: Understanding her Smart Tv and OTA. 
  - Home visit: 
  I went to her apartment to see her devices.  She had a Smart Tv with ethernet, OTA and spectrum internet.
  Mary didnt realize that her OTA was not connected, didnt know how to set up smart tv to the internet.  I tested her internet
  and the wifi speed was average of 3.5 mbs. Mary previous had a subscritption to Spectrum to receive local channels because her 
  antenna was not broadcasting them, but the cost was not substainable.  Her wifi signal was not strong enough for streaming 
  video.  I provided her with a ethernet RJ45 cable and connected wired to her smart tv.  This resloved the problem to her
  streaming video and local channels access. We practiced navigating the smart tv and setting up free trials of hulu and netflix.  
  I advised to keep practicing and let me know of any concerns or what is working at our next workshop.
  
  Summary:
  Great participation, streaming video, in the workshop.  The hands on excerices helped significantly in learning and maintaining
  concepts.
