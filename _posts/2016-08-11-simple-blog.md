After days of trying to set up a simple static blog and to host it online I finally found the perfect fit for me. 
First a special thank you to [Barry Clark](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-kickstart/).

I have watch videos in regards to jekyll and github pages, only to find out there is more dependcies then I thought possible for a simple blog site.  Sometimes I dont want to learn a lot of different ways to do a very simple task as posting a post on a blog site.  I wasnt a fan of Word Press and just wanted to build from my local computer and push to github; add my git url to my main portfolio site.  I didnt want any serve side lanagues and complex configurations.  Less is best, especially in programming.  

Barry had gone thru similar journey and created a simple static repo that anyone can fork and customize and make your own.  Now on to other code.
