# Streaming Video Class - Day 1

Day 1 of the Streaming Video course, was ok, considering this was a new avenue for me.  
My focus ,on Day 1, was on Email - setting up username, send, reply and recovery phone number.  This I felt was
important to know because streaming video depends on emails for a username.  

I have, so far, decided on 4 segments for the class, as follows: 

1. Email - Set up email - google account - needed for username for streaming services.
2. Streaming Services - Activating service, such as, Netflix or Hulu Live TV.
3. Streaming Devices - Setup up of devices, such as, Roku Stick or Fire Stick. 
4. Informed Decisions - Comparing channels, prices based on consumer needs. 

I spent roughly 30-45 minutes on email setup and password recovery, watching short videos and taking questions.
I spent another 30-45 minutes hands-on, workshop with students to create their own accounts, one on one help. 
I felt students were very engaged, most of the time, and benefited greatly with the one on one help.

I had  students bring their own device, if they had one, most had a tablet, and 2 of them had a phone that didnt have a good connection to the web to create their google account(s).

I plan on setting of a mobile hot spot along with Blanton's wifi in the basement.  I hope this will improve internet connection for some.  

I also, have the commputer from Metro Gov. Digital Inclusion Department - I am going to let those with just phones, use while in class. 

I feel that spending the first part of class with concepts of the related subject(email in this case) and the 2nd half with the hands on project.  

These are short projects, and I encourage students to watch video(s) out of class and email me any questions they may have.
I feel emailing, to contact me, will give them real world practice.

Preparing for next wednesday at 1pm:  I am working on hand outs, reference or cheat sheet for students to work with when they are at home, and to jot down any questions they have and or email me.  

I am thinking about bringing my small tv with fire stick for the 2nd half of class - and possible a quick over view on email.
