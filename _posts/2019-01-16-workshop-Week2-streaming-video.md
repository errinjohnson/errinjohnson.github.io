## Productive Workshop Today!

Workshop platform - no videos today.

### We started with questions from the last class and the homework challenge.  
#### Issues:
  1. Typing in website address, mainly syntax errors. I explained to watch for error messages and to check
  for spelling or syntax first if trouble with opening up website link. Practice typing in web addresses.
  2. Email challenge was completed; class used email to communicate with me thru out the week.  
### Today's activity included: 
1. Each student brought there own device, ipad(s) and android tablet.  We started searching for a speed test app, downloading it and then
   testing wifi speed of the conference room. 
2. Searched and downloaded Kroger app, created an account, and registered kroger cards.  
3. Practiced searching and browsing on the web; searched each others names and what sites they were on and why.

This weeks Challenge is to test their wifi speed at their home; test 3 download and upload speeds and email me the results.
