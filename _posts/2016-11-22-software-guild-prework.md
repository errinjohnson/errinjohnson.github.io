title: Software Guild Prework 
---

I started the pre-work for the Software Guild and things are going well; the actual JAVA co-hort
starts the first week in Febuary 2017.  Its going to be a great opptunity to be able to
finally put all my knowledge into practice and then add JAVA to my portfolio. It will give me an
opportuity to measure my skills and build my confidence as a new developer. I have a good
idea in the direction I would like to take my software development; custom applications
is big part of my software development journey, with this in mind it will narrow my focus 
that much more and I will be able to fine tune my career.
