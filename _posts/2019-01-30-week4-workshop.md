title: Streaming Video Class - Week 4
---

## Intro
The workshop started out with progress on their homework, in regards, to searching and comparing devices to buy.
A couple went to local walmart, target etc to check out the devices up close and personal. They, still didnt know which model
of Fire Stick to choose from.  It can be daunting to research and choose one that best fits your needs.

I ask why they decided on the Fire Stick, there was no special reason.  I suggested ROKU because of the flexiblity and ease of use 
and that the Fire Stick would be a good choice for those who already had Amazon Prime, and in my research, Amazon Prime has a lot
of their own real estate as where ROKU had nearyl none and felt they were more of a competitve market.  

The workshop continued with the setup of existing Antenna from one student KP that wrote down instructions from previous workshop
to scan channels.  There was a misunderstanding when I stated "Menu" and not "Manual" which I may of done.  This encouraged me 
to print out check list and instructions to better assist the students.  Eventually, the website will be a good source, but that is
still a work in progress on to capture the correct audience.  It is changing as I create it.  

This first class - workshop is the starting point of a much bigger project.  I am using this as a foundation to set up activites best
suited for the community based on users needs.  

## Activities
- Comparing devices and prices.
- Setting up Antenna and Scanning for Channels.
- Googled FCC Antenna and typed in our address to see local channels we could receive. 
- Talked about Antenna signal strength and what the normal user in this community receives, which is about 49 to 50 channels.
- Talked some about Antenna to buy but class was cut short because of conflict of time and another event.

## Summary
I started on creating print outs, reference sheets based Comparing Devices and Prices. I feel this is important to help
students explore from home and have more success in completing their goals. 
A couple students do need a computer, they only have a cell phone, and I am looking into that. 
Im changing the website to improve clarity and ease of use for students.
