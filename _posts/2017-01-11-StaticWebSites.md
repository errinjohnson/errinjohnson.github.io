[Software Guild Contact for Tuition Sponsorship in Progress](#)

Organize code with templates from [Mustache.js](https://mustache.github.io/)

I am looking to earn the remaining $2,000 of the Software Guild tution in the form
of sponsorship and internship web development work.  I hope to build confidence, earn money
and contribute to my own education.  Build relations with the buisness technlogy community.

I am creating a profile to build static websites and or applications; I can 
set up your domain with AWS Domain Service and AWS s3 storage and have your local work sync to production.
I can set up your static site with smooth deployment from your BitBucket Repositories.  
Also, I can link a simple blog which I am doing here with Jeckyll and Github Pages.



I believe the internship | sponsorship pathway into the Software Guild will build a strong foundation
of credibility needed for a new software developer.  It does require good communication skills and working
with others.  It would truly feel like belonging to a guild. 

Im currently communicationg with Software Guild to set up smooth transition to have a contact person that
could invoice the sponsors in reference to my account to pay for my tution. I will update as I move forward. 

Stay Tuned!
Best Errin E Johnson
