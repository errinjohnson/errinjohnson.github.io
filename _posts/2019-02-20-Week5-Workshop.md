title: Streaming Video and TV Class - Week 5

## Wrapping UP and Starting Over

What have we learned in week 5 of the streaming video class?  Let's try and break it down. 

I would say the last five weeks has been successful in at least one area.  Participation and 
the continue willness to learn is still there. Today's workshop was about moving forward and 
learning from our successes and what are challenges are. 

There has been a better understanding of what streaming video services can offer and what devices
are compatiable to stream quality videos and local tv with HD antenna. 

We talked about Internet Service Providers, internet quality and speed; we talked about the differences 
of the internet in the home that is wired and that is wifi. 
As far as the low price on internet, offered by Spectrum and AT&t, our students, didnt qualify.  Moving forward. 

We have been making informed decisions.  Students have been taking the initiative to compare prices and 
research devices, by going to Walmart and Bestbuy.  We discussed in class what each student would like to
watch on their T.V. and what would fit into their budget; what are their streaming video and t.v. needs? 

The biggest challenge to teach a workshop on streaming video and T.V. is the broad spectrum of services and devices
and... broad spectrum of the students devices, from the Ipad to the smart phone. The learning curve to learn 
and understand their own devices is complex.  I would like to have all students on the same type of device to
learn and have different workshop to learn their devices.  

Back to the drawing board.  
FYI we will be meeting same day and time next week. Wednesday 1pm -3pm.  Agenda will be annoucned later.
