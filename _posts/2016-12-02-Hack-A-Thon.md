Saturday December 3, 2016 is the WorldWide event and here in Louisville, Ky we are participating.
Its going to be a great weekend for [Hack-A-Thon](https://her.is/2gCdwuc).  I will be updated this post with experiences and perspectives of my day, pictures too.

We had a "lights Out"  Code Challenge which was the highlight of my day. We had 30 minutes to code a website with CSS and HTML with no preview of code. I realized, how much I relied on my text editor and I wasnt alone in the aniexty of not able to preview your code before you submitted the final results. I was so looking forward to particpating in this contest.  When the 30 minutes was up and we all submitted our code; The results were displayed on the screen. When my code came up, all that was there was a white screen.  [My response]().

A lot of great events today, we had great food provide by POE Company thru out the day.  Special Thanks to Valentin Staller, Lindsey and Sumerlynn for hosting our Hack-A-Thon event for #CodeLouisville.  Beautiful scenery at the [River Park Apartments](http://www.riverparkplace.net/apartments/), great Gigabyte speed thru AT&T.
