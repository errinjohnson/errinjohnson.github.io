title: Software Prework Complete
---

update: 2-24-2017

Software Guild, no longer on my list of places to attend.  Going in a differenct direction for now.

I finished the Software Guild pre-work which consisted of basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I did well!
Apparently, there is an audition they added to the mix, or maybe I missed it and thats to see if the pre-work
you completed online is inline with you doing the work, my assumptions anyway.  I have that audition tomorrow
online with an instructor from the software guild.  Im feeling good about it.  The actual JAVA co-hort starts
Febuary 6th, 2017.  Im still thinking of creative ways to raise the remaining $2,000; currently you are not able
to get a federal loan which for me is not the best avenue anyway.  Looking for sponsors for the final $2,000.  
Im getting on that today, will update later on the path and progress of getting sponsors.  Be Well eej
