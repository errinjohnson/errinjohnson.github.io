title: Simplifying my portfolio blog!
---
After searhing for simple blog with an online presense to measure my skills and progress in software development, I finally found one I could use.  Thanks to [Barry Clark](https://github.com/nobilelucifero/jekyll-kickstart) where I believe my  understanding of not wanting my blog to be connected with dependcies, configurations, servers was inline with Barry.  I was able to fork his repo and get started right away with posting this blog.
