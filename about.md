### More Information
I started learing to code in November 2013 with an online learning platform, [tree house profile](https://teamtreehouse.com/errinejohnson); I joined [Code Louisville](https://codelouisville.org/)Team Developer Portal for Weds Night FrontEnd Team (1st QTR 2015 Group), went on to join their PHP cohort.  I realized the passion I have for code and wanted to find my niche within the IoT. I took a big interest in creating API's and having an online presence to show my work. The biggest hurdle for me was what to learn to narrow my focus on devloping custom API's. I decided to apply for a bootcamp here in Louisville, KY., Software Guild. I felt the momentum and narrow focus of study in JAVA would bring my knowledge to a level that would produce income stability, it was time to put confidence into my passions.  I start the cohort Febuary 2017.
